# publii-test
a test for using Publii with GitHub and Cloudflare pages
I've been looking at using publii onto GitHub Pages and then onto Cloudflare Pages hosting.
Says you can use private repo then link this to Cloudflare.
Give it a try and see what works and what doesn't
Have created simple Publii site in order to load to this repo
