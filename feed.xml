                <p>For years I’d been usig Squarespace. Not because I was a fan, more because I had clients on it and it was just easier to add an extra site for me on the back of the commercial sites.</p>
<p>What finished me off was the lack of flexibility. As with all these template driven sites (even this Publii one) they know best, they dictate how things will look and what your final output will be.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, this saves time and ensures consistancey and all that but I’ve never been one for being consistant, ordered or tidy. What got me most about Squarespace though and this is not a knocking piece. It’s really unnecessarily difficult to put somthing as simple as a Pdf up on their site. I like Pdf’s, they retain the look, feel, fonts, layout of what I was working in. It’s a way to break the hegonomy of the template. Yes, I know templates are there to be adjusted and amended but this all takes time and where do we get that from?</p>
<p>For this new site I’m planning on using a combination of <a href="https://getpublii.com">Publii</a>, <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">CloudFlare Pages</a>. Takes a while to bring it all together but should be worth the effort.</p>
